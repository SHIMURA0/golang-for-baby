# Golang-for-baby

## To learn Golang, we begin with the syntax of writing hello world.

The following is the fully excutable go program of "Hello World!"

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```
First, note that at very beginning, we have the line 
```go
package main
```
Every go script begins with the 
```go
package ${filename}
```
where ${filename} is the name of the go script. In this way, a go project is structured as a collection of packagesã€‚

this is $\mathscr{A}$
